# AI-ML-Capstone-1-Final
# AI & ML Capstone 1 – Final Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains the final submission for **AI & Machine Learning Capstone 1**. The project demonstrates end‑to‑end application of data analysis and machine learning techniques, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model development, and evaluation.

The main work is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook and is intended to be reproducible and easy to follow.
